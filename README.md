# A NOBLE ACT IN BENGUELA

**By: WN**

Today, a kind-hearted soul showed what it truly means to be compassionate. **Fernanda Mariana Ngala Miguel MÃ¡quina**, the Children's Deputy of Benguela, went above and beyond to aid a mother of five.

Fernanda heard of a mother's challenging situation: welcoming triplets while already having two young children. Knowing the family needed help, she sprang into action. Accompanied by the Provincial Director of INAC and the Municipal Directorate of Social Action, she personally delivered essential goods to the mother, who also works in the fields to make ends meet.

Through her efforts, this young deputy, who is an inspiration to many, mobilized sponsors and gathered necessities to ease the family's burden. She demonstrated that age is no barrier to making a profound difference in people's lives.

This story serves as a reminder that every act of kindness, no matter how small, can significantly impact someone's life. We salute Fernanda's noble gesture and hope it inspires each one of us to lend a helping hand.
